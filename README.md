## Dependency Injection Idea
Idea on how to handle a certain dependency injection situation. 

Run `TEST=tester ts-node index.ts` and you should see the following output on the command line
```
Starting car: tester
Engine Started
```

you can change `TEST=<any text>` and what you input should show up after the columns
